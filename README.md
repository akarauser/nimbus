Weather Time Series Forecasting

This script performs time series forecasting of temperature data using the Prophet library. The script loads cleaned weather forecast data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, and utilizes Prophet to generate future temperature predictions. The code includes error handling, data type conversion, and performance metrics (MSE and R²) for evaluation. The script utilizes a train-test split for robust model evaluation.
